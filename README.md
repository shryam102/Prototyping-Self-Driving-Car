# Prototyping-Self-Driving-Car
Overview
This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a self-driving car prototype built on a big electric ride-on toy for kids. The project utilizes a Servo motor with gears to control the steering mechanism, and the car is powered and controlled using an Arduino Uno. The car can be operated manually or automatically, with a switch to transition between modes.
