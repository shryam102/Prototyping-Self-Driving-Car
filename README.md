# Prototyping-Self-Driving-Car
## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a self-driving car prototype built on a big electric ride-on toy for kids. The project utilizes a Servo motor with gears to control the steering mechanism, and the car is powered and controlled using an Arduino Uno. The car can be operated manually or automatically, with a switch to transition between modes.

## Features
* **Manual and Automatic Modes**: The car can be controlled manually or switched to automatic mode.
* **Straight Movement with PID**: In automatic mode, the car moves in a straight line, correcting deviations using a simple PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.
* **Future Goals**: The project aims to achieve full autonomy, enabling the car to navigate to specified GPS locations autonomously.
